<!-- Comments:
 This lab was quite very helpful. It took me about 6 hours to complete. I learnt
 quite a number of concepts in JavaScipt which contradicted the programming knowledge
 I had from Java.
 I learnt how to clone arrays efficiently in JavaScript using [...array]
 I learnt how the list data structure works in JavaScript
 I learnt how to test for object equality in JavaScript. Not just references but also
 checking the object's properties
 ...and many more concepts.
