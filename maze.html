<!--Comment:
I found this lab quite helpful. It was great practice for working with jQuery event handlers.
The main challenge I found with this lab is that I didn't know how to activate and deactivate
the event listeners. In the case where I was using alert to display "you win" or "you lose",
the alerts were displayed even when the user hadn't started playing yet as long as they moved
the mouse pointer over the maze region.
In total I spent about an hour on this lab.-->

<h1>The Amazing Mouse Maze!</h1>

    The object of this game is to guide the mouse cursor through the start area and get to the end area.  Be sure to avoid the walls:
