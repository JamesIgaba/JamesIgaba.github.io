<!--Comments:
This lab was good practice for working with jQuery. In total, I spent about 4 hours on this lab.
The main challenge I faced was in changing the size of the circles. It wasn't working as I expected.
I later logged the new size to the console and found out that concatenation was being performed
instead of addition. This was solved when I used parseInt to change the value to a string.-->
